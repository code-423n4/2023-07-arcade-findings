## Arcade Project: Gas Report

### [G-01] Cache the storage variable
In general, if a state variable is read more than once, caching its value to a local variable and reusing it will save gas since a storage read spends more gas than a memory write plus a memory read.


`lastAllowanceSet[token]` is used 2 times, recommend caching it.

### [G-02] Use `delete` operation instead of assigning the value 0 

When resetting the storage slot, `delete` is handy and gas effective. Use `delete` for below instances, 

**File: ARCDVestingVault.sol**
```solidity
    function revokeGrant(address who) external virtual onlyManager {
        .. SNIP...
        // delete the grant
        grant.allocation = 0;
        grant.cliffAmount = 0;
        grant.withdrawn = 0;
        grant.created = 0;
        grant.expiration = 0;
        grant.cliff = 0;
        grant.latestVotingPower = 0;
        grant.delegatee = address(0);
    }
```
