#1 - non-critical
Inconsistent usage of the `event VoteChange` arguments. The `from` and `to` fields are incorrectly used in various instances.

BaseVotingVault.sol line 41:
```
    event VoteChange(address indexed from, address indexed to, int256 amount);
```
ARCDVestingVault.sol line 148:
```
    emit VoteChange(grant.delegatee, who, int256(uint256(newVotingPower)));
```

The grant recipient `who` is transferring votes to `grant.delegatee`. The emitted event states otherwise.

ARCDVestingVault.sol line 269:
```
    emit VoteChange(grant.delegatee, msg.sender, -1 * int256(grant.latestVotingPower));
```
The `msg.sender` is taking away votes from the current `grant.delegatee`. The emitted event states otherwise that 
`grant.delegatee` is taking away votes from `msg.sender`.

ARCDVestingVault.sol line 281:
```
    emit VoteChange(to, msg.sender, int256(uint256(grant.latestVotingPower)));
```
The `msg.sender` is transferring votes to the variable `to`. The emitted event states otherwise.
