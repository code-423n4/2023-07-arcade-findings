Badge NFT multipliers seems to give a small group of users too much power(assuming this group will likely have the most tokens compared to average user), especially it multiplies entire amount of token an user has. I would recommend having fixed amount of voting power for each badge NFT. In addition, the protocol is allowed to set the multiplier for badge NFT. This seems a bit unfair for individuals trying to complete tasks for "achievement" in order to receive badge NFT-the protocol can later reduce the multipliers to 0.

Overall the codebase within the scope is solid but would've loved to know how vesting schedule works, so more testing can be done.
