As a beginner this was a nice opportunity to look inside and learn the inner workings of a governance system, although the learning experience was a bit diminished by the core voting process being out of scope. 
The protocol looked pretty safe, mostly due to the fact that most of the meaningful actions where administrative, and I'm looking forward to see what other, more experienced, wardens have found.
For 2 of the 3 findings that I have reported, I haven't provided a coded PoC since I have not found a good way to express front running and ordering of instructions inside a block with a script (beside simply ordering the functions as if they where meant to be called that way, which doesn't seems particularly "interesting", I'm really looking forwards for feedbacks on this (if possible), as it is a recurrent "issue" that I'm having).
All the analysis was done manually.
