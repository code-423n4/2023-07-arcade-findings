## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- Started with the docs to have a full grasp of the project
- Briefly went through my personal auditing guidline to refresh my memory.
- Then the codes in scope line by line
- Took a brief look at other contracts not in scope for a clearer picture
- Back to the docs to counter some notes I made while going through codebase
- Discussed a few ideas with sponsors to understand their design choice and why I think it's risky or how I can recommend a better method to implement the strategies
- Finally then back to the codebase to sum up my reports/findings
  Note: I usually don't write my reports on the last day, but rather a few each day while working on a contest, so on the last day I must have gotten more context of the project and can then edit a few reports, finalize others or let them be, more of as the situation calls and final review.

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
Multiple things, to list a few:
- learnt about autonomous borrowing, lending, and escrow of NFT collateral on EVM blockchains
- managed to get some new and important knowledge on token-based governance system
- came across Council Framework for the very first time while working on this project

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
As a passionate and aspiring smart contract auditor, I  had the opportunity to conduct an audit of this smart contract. Throughout the process, I diligently assessed the codebase, aiming to identify potential vulnerabilities. While I exerted my best efforts and attention to detail, I acknowledge that as a newbie, there might be room for error. I am open to constructive feedback and eager to learn from experienced auditors to enhance my skills further. My intention was solely to contribute to the security and reliability of the project, and I assure you that no malicious intent was involved. I am grateful for this learning experience and humbly present my findings before you. I look forward to hearing your feedback on my findings.
