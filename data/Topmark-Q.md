Wrong Function Call of votingPower.loadTop(...) and votingPower.push(...) of L581 & L590 respectively and 8 other instances in NFTBoostVault.sol contract. votingPower from assessment of the code is coming from BaseVotingVault.sol through _votingPower(), which returns History.load("votingPower"); instead of History.loadTop(...) & History.push(...) as declared from the History.sol contract linked to it. Not Declaring the Function right could affect the whole code execution and contract functionality
