As a participant in the auditing contest on CODE4RENA for Arcade.xyz, a platform for autonomous borrowing, lending, and escrow of NFT collateral on EVM blockchains, I had the opportunity to evaluate the smart contracts involved in the governance system.  I aimed to ensure the security and reliability of the platform and submitted various reports during the contest.

As a participant in the Arcade.xyz governance system audit contest on CODE4RENA, I had the opportunity to gain valuable insights and learning experiences:

 Real-World Smart Contract Auditing: Participating in the audit contest provided hands-on experience in auditing real-world smart contracts, which enhanced my understanding of the practical challenges and complexities involved in assessing blockchain-based systems.

 Smart Contract Security Best Practices: Reviewing the Arcade.xyz contracts allowed me to deepen my knowledge of smart contract security best practices. I learned to identify potential vulnerabilities and propose security improvements to ensure the integrity and safety of the platform.

 Advanced Governance Mechanisms: Analyzing the novel vote-counting mechanisms and governance structures used by Arcade.xyz exposed me to advanced concepts in decentralized governance systems, expanding my understanding beyond basic token-based mechanisms.

 ERC20 and ERC1155 Token Standards: Reviewing the ERC20 and ERC1155 token contracts increased my familiarity with these token standards and their specific use cases in governance and voting mechanisms.

 Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills: The audit contest challenged me to apply problem-solving and analytical skills to thoroughly assess the codebase, identify potential risks, and propose appropriate solutions.

 Formal Verification Techniques: Exploring formal verification techniques during the audit deepened my understanding of methods for mathematically proving the correctness of smart contracts, emphasizing the importance of verifiable code.

 Ethical Considerations in Auditing: Engaging in an ethical audit process underscored the significance of handling sensitive financial and user-related data responsibly and adhering to strict ethical guidelines.
 

Comprehensive Review: I performed a thorough examination of the smart contracts, including Voting Vaults, Core Voting Contracts, ERC20 governance token contracts, and ERC1155 token contracts.
Documentation Analysis: I referred to the natspec for technical details, which helped in understanding the contract functionalities and requirements in-depth.
Security Analysis: I conducted a rigorous security analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities and weak points in the codebase.
New Insights and Learnings:

Governance Mechanisms: Through this contest, I gained valuable insights into how decentralized governance systems work and how they grant control and ownership over lending protocols.
Advanced Voting Mechanisms: The novel vote-counting mechanisms in Voting Vaults provided me with exposure to unique voting solutions in the blockchain space.
Token Standards: I became familiar with the ERC20 and ERC1155 token standards, their roles in governance, and the process of voting power allocation.
Broader Concerns:

Systematic Risks: I assessed the platform for potential systematic risks that could lead to widespread issues or losses affecting a large number of users.
Centralization Risks: I evaluated the governance system to identify any centralization risks that might undermine the decentralized nature of the protocol.
Growth of Skills and Code Reviewer's Skills:

Smart Contract Security: Participation in this audit contest allowed me to gain practical experience in smart contract security assessment and to propose improvements for mitigating potential risks.
Decentralized Governance: I deepened my understanding of how decentralized protocols are governed, ensuring transparency and inclusivity in decision-making processes.
Formal Verification Techniques: As a code reviewer, I explored formal verification techniques to ensure contract correctness and adherence to specifications.
In conclusion, my participation in the Arcade.xyz governance system audit contest on CODE4RENA was an enriching experience. The process provided me with valuable insights into decentralized governance mechanisms, advanced voting systems, and smart contract security practices. The analysis of systematic and centralization risks contributed to a comprehensive evaluation of the platform's overall robustness. These experiences not only helped me grow as a computer engineering student but also enhanced my skills as a code reviewer, enabling me to make meaningful contributions to the security and reliability of blockchain-based systems in future audits and assessments.
