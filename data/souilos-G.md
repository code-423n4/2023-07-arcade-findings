### Mitigation 

Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison.










# VULN 2 

## [GAS] ++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} and ++i costs less gas than i++
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 144 at 2023-07-arcadexyz/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol:

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _claimData.length; i++) {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in for and while-loops. Moreover ++i costs less gas than i++, especially when its used in for-loops (--i/i-- too).

## [GAS] Donâ€™t initialize variables with default value
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Proof of concept 

Found in line 345 at 2023-07-arcadexyz/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol:

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userAddresses.length; ++i) {


Found in line 339 at 2023-07-arcadexyz/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol:

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _claimData.length; i++) {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

In such cases, initializing the variables with default values would be unnecessary and can be considered a waste of gas. Additionally, initializing variables with default values can sometimes lead to unnecessary storage operations, which can increase gas costs. For example, if you have a large array of variables, initializing them all with default values can result in a lot of unnecessary storage writes, which can increase the gas costs of your contract.

### Mitigation 

Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost.

### Mitigation 

Mark data types as calldata instead of memory where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as calldata. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies memory storage.

### Mitigation 

If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).

### Mitigation 

Using assembly to check for the zero address can result in significant gas savings compared to using a Solidity expression, especially if the check is performed frequently or in a loop. However, it's important to note that using assembly can make the code less readable and harder to maintain, so it should be used judiciously and with caution.

### Mitigation 

When you use the += operator on a state variable, the EVM has to perform three operations: load the current value of the state variable, add the new value to it, and then store the result back in the state variable. On the other hand, when you use the = operator and then add the values separately, the EVM only needs to perform two operations: load the current value of the state variable and add the new value to it. Better use <x> = <x> + <y> For State Variables.

### Mitigation 

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

Instead of using address(this), it is more gas-efficient to pre-calculate and use the hardcoded address. Foundryâ€™s script.sol and solmateâ€™s LibRlp.sol contracts can help achieve this.

    function setBaseURI(string memory newBaseURI) external onlyOwner {

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

If a function modifier or require such as onlyOwner/onlyX is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are CALLVALUE(2), DUP1(3), ISZERO(3), PUSH2(3), JUMPI(10), PUSH1(3), DUP1(3), REVERT(0), JUMPDEST(1), POP(2) which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where itâ€™s used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.

### Mitigation 

The compiler uses opcodes GT and ISZERO for solidity code that uses >, but only requires LT for >=, which saves 3 gas.

## [GAS] With assembly, .call (bool success) transfer can be done gas-optimized

### Proof of concept 

Found in 2023-07-arcadexyz/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol (function batchCalls():

    ) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) nonReentrant {

        if (targets.length != calldatas.length) revert T_ArrayLengthMismatch();

        // execute a package of low level calls

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets.length; ++i) {

            if (spendThresholds[targets[i]].small != 0) revert T_InvalidTarget(targets[i]);

            (bool success, ) = targets[i].call(calldatas[i]);

            // revert if a single call fails

            if (!success) revert T_CallFailed();

        }

    }




------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

return data (bool success,) has to be stored due to EVM architecture, but in a usage like below, â€˜outâ€™ and â€˜outsizeâ€™ values are given (0,0), this storage disappears and gas optimization is provided.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be abstract and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty if-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...} => if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}).

### Mitigation 

Use assembly to write address storage values. Here are a few reasons: * Reduced opcode usage: When using assembly, you can directly manipulate storage values using lower-level instructions like sstore (storage store) instead of relying on higher-level Solidity storage assignments. These direct operations typically result in fewer opcode executions, reducing gas costs. * Avoiding unnecessary checks: Solidity storage assignments often involve additional checks and operations, such as enforcing security modifiers or triggering events. By using assembly, you can bypass these additional checks and perform the necessary storage operations directly, resulting in gas savings. * Optimized packing: Assembly provides greater flexibility in packing and unpacking data structures. By carefully arranging and manipulating the storage layout in assembly, you can achieve more efficient storage utilization and minimize wasted storage space. * Fine-grained control: Assembly allows for precise control over gas-consuming operations. You can optimize gas usage by selecting specific instructions and minimizing unnecessary operations or data copying.
