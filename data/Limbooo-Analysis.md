In evaluating the Arcade.xyz protocol, a thorough examination of the smart contract codebase was conducted, focusing on security, functionality, and code quality. The code demonstrated sound architectural principles, but lacked sufficient documentation and comments in some areas, potentially affecting code readability and maintainability. Furthermore, certain sections posed centralization risks due to the governance structure and control over critical functionalities.

One critical security vulnerability was identified in the NFTBoostVault contract, which has the potential for unauthorized access and transfer of other users' NFTs. By manipulating tokenId and tokenAddress parameters, malicious actors could potentially exploit this flaw to gain control over valuable assets belonging to other users. While not fully proven through testing, the theoretical existence of this risk demands immediate attention and remediation. Additionally, a division-by-zero issue in the ARCDVestingVault contract raised concerns about the proper execution of functions, possibly leading to the inaccessibility of funds.

Moreover, a total supply exhaustion vulnerability was discovered in the ArcadeToken contract. This issue, combined with the token's burn feature and strict minting constraints, could potentially result in a diminishing total supply and a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on the minting functionality.

In light of these findings, it is crucial to implement stringent access controls, thorough input validation, and comprehensive testing, including penetration testing, to bolster the platform's security. Addressing centralization risks in governance and fostering decentralization will be essential for creating a more resilient ecosystem.
