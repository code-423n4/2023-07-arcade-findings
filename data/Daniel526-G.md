1. The ARCDVestingVault contract lacks a restriction on the number of times the delegation can be changed or the frequency of delegation changes. This absence of restriction allows users to change their delegation freely, potentially leading to gas overhead and manipulation of the voting system.

```solidity
function delegate(address to) external {
    ARCDVestingVaultStorage.Grant storage grant = _grants()[msg.sender];
    if (to == grant.delegatee) revert AVV_AlreadyDelegated();

    // Update the delegatee without any restriction on the delegation changes
    grant.delegatee = to;

    // Rest of the delegation logic remains unchanged...
}

```
Gas Overhead: Frequent delegation changes can result in increased gas costs for users, especially if there are multiple changes within a short period. This can be financially burdensome for users and reduce the efficiency of the contract.
