# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Arcade.xyz smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between July 21 â€” July 28 2023.

This audit was judged by [0xean](https://code4rena.com/@0xean).

Final report assembled by thebrittfactor.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 8 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 8 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 20 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 10 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Arcade.xyz repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade), and is composed of 12 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 979 lines of Solidity code.

In addition to the known issues identified by the project team, a Code4rena bot race was conducted at the start of the audit. The winning bot, **c4lanky** from warden favelanky, generated the [Automated Findings report](https://gist.github.com/itsmetechjay/e494eb18a34459c4d7841fc6fdc700e1) and all findings therein were classified as out of scope.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# Medium Risk Findings (8)
## [[M-01] `_syncVotingPower` can revert in underflow in `NFTBoostVault.sol` and `ARCDVestingVault.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/572)
*Submitted by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/572), also found by [Topmark](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/540)*

### Lines of code:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/f8ac4e7c4fdea559b73d9dd5606f618d4e6c73cd/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L593

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/f8ac4e7c4fdea559b73d9dd5606f618d4e6c73cd/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L352

### Proof of Concept

Note this function:

```solidity
   function _syncVotingPower(address who, NFTBoostVaultStorage.Registration storage registration) internal {
        History.HistoricalBalances memory votingPower = _votingPower();
        uint256 delegateeVotes = votingPower.loadTop(registration.delegatee);

        uint256 newVotingPower = _currentVotingPower(registration);
        // get the change in voting power. Negative if the voting power is reduced

        int256 change = int256(newVotingPower) - int256(uint256(registration.latestVotingPower));

        // do nothing if there is no change
        if (change == 0) return;
        if (change > 0) {
            votingPower.push(registration.delegatee, delegateeVotes + uint256(change));
        } else {
            // if the change is negative, we multiply by -1 to avoid underflow when casting
            votingPower.push(registration.delegatee, delegateeVotes - uint256(change * -1));
        }

        registration.latestVotingPower = uint128(newVotingPower);

        emit VoteChange(who, registration.delegatee, change);
    }

```

We need to pay special attention to this line of code:

```solidity
  votingPower.push(registration.delegatee, delegateeVotes - uint256(change * -1));
```

It is possible that `delegateeVotes` - changes can revert in underflow. This only happens when we try to reduce the voting power.

In `_withdrawNFT`, if an NFT with a high multipler is removed in `NFTBoostVault.sol` it can cause the [voting power to decrease](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/f8ac4e7c4fdea559b73d9dd5606f618d4e6c73cd/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L569).

```solidity
// update the delegatee's voting power based on multiplier removal
_syncVotingPower(msg.sender, registration);
```

Or, in `ARCDVestingVault.sol` when an admin tries to [revoke a user's grant](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/f8ac4e7c4fdea559b73d9dd5606f618d4e6c73cd/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L175).

```solidity
// update the grant's withdrawn amount
if (amount == withdrawable) {
	grant.withdrawn += uint128(withdrawable);
} else {
	grant.withdrawn += uint128(amount);
	withdrawable = amount;
}

// update the user's voting power
_syncVotingPower(msg.sender, grant);
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Before calling `delegateeVotes - uint256(change * -1)`, make sure `delegateeVotes > uint256(change * -1)`, otherwise just set to 0.

## [[M-02] Proposal vote power can be easily manipulated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/434)
*Submitted by [DadeKuma](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/434)*

### Lines of code

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ArcadeGSCCoreVoting.sol#L32>

### Impact

`ArcadeGSCCoreVoting` can be a target of vote manipulation. An attacker might be able to take a huge loan (even uncollateralized) for a single block before creating a proposal.

When voting, only this single block is checked when calculating the `votingPower`. This may lead to an attacker being able to execute arbitrary proposals with minimal risks involved.

### Proof of Concept

When a proposal is created, the timestamp registered is the block before the creation. This mitigates flash loan attacks, but it's still possible to manipulate the vote with a normal loan:

```solidity
proposals[proposalCount] = Proposal(
    proposalHash,
    // Note we use blocknumber - 1 here as a flash loan mitigation.
    uint128(block.number - 1), //@audit created
    uint128(block.number + lockDuration),
    uint128(block.number + lockDuration + extraVoteTime),
    uint128(quorum),
    proposals[proposalCount].votingPower,
    uint128(lastCall)
);
```
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/external/council/CoreVoting.sol#L172-L181>

During a `vote`, the `msg.sender` voting power is queried and it will use the previous `created` field:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < votingVaults.length; i++) {
    // ensure there are no voting vault duplicates
    for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < votingVaults.length; j++) {
        require(votingVaults[i] != votingVaults[j], "duplicate vault");
    }
    require(approvedVaults[votingVaults[i]], "unverified vault");
    votingPower += uint128(
        IVotingVault(votingVaults[i]).queryVotePower(
            msg.sender,
            proposals[proposalId].created,
            extraVaultData[i]
        )
    );
}
```
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/external/council/CoreVoting.sol#L234-L238>

If the attacker took a huge loan (even uncollateralized) for that single block, they would be able to manipulate the vote with minimal slippage, as it's only one block.

If this happens, they would be able to execute any arbitrary code, if `queryVotePower` depends on the amount of tokens held by the attacker.

### Note about severity

By reading the comments in `ArcadeGSCCoreVoting` it seems that the voting vault used will be the `ArcadeGSCVault`:

```solidity
 * The Arcade GSC Core Voting contract allows members of the GSC vault to vote on and execute proposals
 * in an instance of governance separate from general governance votes.
```

In this case, this issue can't occur, as the `votingPower` does not depend on the amount held by the attacker:

```solidity
// If the address queried is the owner they get a huge number of votes
// This allows the primary governance timelock to take any action the GSC
// can make or block any action the GSC can make. But takes as many votes as
// a protocol upgrade.
if (who == owner) {
    return 100000;
}
// If the who has been in the GSC longer than idleDuration
// return 1 and otherwise return 0.
if (
    members[who].joined > 0 &&
    (members[who].joined + idleDuration) <= block.timestamp
) {
    return 1;
} else {
    return 0;
}    
```
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/external/council/vaults/GSCVault.sol#L145-L167>

However, it's worth noting that this situation might change in the future, as `ArcadeGSCCoreVoting` approved vaults can be multiple, and they are not immutable:

```solidity
/// @notice Updates the status of a voting vault.
/// @param vault Address of the voting vault.
/// @param isValid True to be valid, false otherwise.
function changeVaultStatus(address vault, bool isValid) external onlyOwner {
    approvedVaults[vault] = isValid;
}
```
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/external/council/CoreVoting.sol#L333-L338>

As there are other vaults that use tokens as voting power (e.g. [LockingVault](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/external/council/vaults/LockingVault.sol#L72-L86)), there is a real possibility that this might occur in the future, so I'm flagging it as high severity.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using a `TWAP` to check the voting power of a proposal, instead of checking only the block before the proposal was created.

### Vulnerability details

*Note: Some of the contracts mentioned are out of scope, but the vulnerability exists in the `BaseVotingVault`, which is in scope, so I argue that the finding is in scope.*

In the Arcade ecosystem, there is a GSC group which has some extra privileges, like spending some token amount from the treasury or creating new proposals in the core voting contract.

In order to become a member of this group, a user has to have a high enough voting power (combined from several voting vaults) and call `proveMembership`. When user's voting power drops beneath a certain threshold, they may be kicked out of the GSC.

`proveMembership` contains the following code:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < votingVaults.length; i++) {
            // Call the vault to check last block's voting power
            // Last block to ensure there's no flash loan or other
            // intra contract interaction
            uint256 votes =
                IVotingVault(votingVaults[i]).queryVotePower(
                    msg.sender,
                    block.number - 1,
                    extraData[i]
                );
            // Add up the votes
            totalVotes += votes;
        }
```

So, it basically iterates over all voting vaults that a user specifies, sums up their voting power, and if it's enough, it grants that user a place in GSC.

In order to kick a user out from the GSC, the `kick` function may be used and it will iterate over all vaults that were supplied by a user when they call `proveMembership` and if their voting power drops beneath the threshold, they will be removed from the GSC. `kick` contains the following code:

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < votingVaults.length; i++) {
            // If the vault is not approved we don't count its votes now
            if (coreVoting.approvedVaults(votingVaults[i])) {
                // Call the vault to check last block's voting power
                // Last block to ensure there's no flash loan or other
                // intra contract interaction
                uint256 votes =
                    IVotingVault(votingVaults[i]).queryVotePower(
                        who,
                        block.number - 1,
                        extraData[i]
                    );
                // Add up the votes
                totalVotes += votes;
            }
        }
```

As we see, `queryVotePower` will be called again on each vault. Let's see how `queryVotePower` is implemented in `BaseVotingVault`, which is used as a base contract for some voting contracts:

```solidity
    function queryVotePower(address user, uint256 blockNumber, bytes calldata) external override returns (uint256) {
        // Get our reference to historical data
        History.HistoricalBalances memory votingPower = _votingPower();


        // Find the historical data and clear everything more than 'staleBlockLag' into the past
        return votingPower.findAndClear(user, blockNumber, block.number - staleBlockLag);
    }
```

As we see, it will always call the `findAndClear` function that will return the most recent voting power and will attempt to erase some older entries. New entries are added for a user when their voting power changes and no more than `1` entry is added to each block (if several changes happen in one block, values are just updated).

Now, the attacker (Bob) may perform the following attack:

1.  Bob acquires enough votes to become a GSC member (they can either just buy enough tokens or deploy a smart contract that will offer a high yield for users who stake their vault tokens there).
2.  Bob calls `proveMembership` and specifies `NFTBoostVault` as a proof. They will be accepted.
3.  Bob "poisons" their voting power history by delegating from and redelegating to themself some dust token amount in several thousand different blocks (possible to do in less than `12h` on Ethereum).
4.  Bob withdraws all their tokens from `NFTBoostVault`.
5.  Alice spots that Bob doesn't have enough voting power anymore and will attempt to kick them, but since `findAndClear` will try to erase several thousand entries, it will exceed the Ethereum block limit for gas and the transaction will revert with Out Of Gas exception (`kick` will iterate over all vaults supplied by Bob, so Alice is forced to call `queryVotePower` on the vault that Bob used for the attack).
6.  Bob can now send tokens to their other account, repeat the attack and they can do this until they have `>50%` in the GSC.

A similar exploit was presented by myself in a different submission, but this one is different; since the previous one focuses on a different aspect of that DoS attack - changing voting outcome. Here, I'm showing how somebody can permanently become a GSC member.

As reported in that different submission, the cost of performing the attack once is `~14ETH`, so it's not that much (currently `14ETH = $1880 * 14 = $26320`), but it may be worth it to perform this attack in order to be able to get `>50%` of GSC.

### Impact

An attacker is able to become a permanent GSC member, even if they don't stake any tokens; which shouldn't be allowed and already has a huge impact on the protocol.

Even worse, they may try to acquire `> 50%` of voting power (GSC shouldn't have too many members - probably about `10` or something like this). Still, the GSC owner has `100,000` votes, but it is a time-lock contract, so might not be able to react fast enough to veto malicious proposals. Even if it is, this attack will destroy the entire GSC (since, from now on, the owner will decide about everything making GSC members useless), which is an important concept in the Arcade protocol.

Hence, the impact is huge (and assets can be lost since GSC is able to spend some tokens from the treasury) and there aren't any external factors allowed. So, I'm submitting this issue as High.

### Proof of Concept

Several modifications are necessary in order to run the test. They are only introduced to make testing easier and don't have anything in common with the attack itself. First of all, please change `Authorizable::setOwner` as follows:

```solidity
    function setOwner(address who) public /*onlyOwner()*/ {
```

Then, please change `NFTBoostVault` so that withdrawals are possible:

```solidity
constructor(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 staleBlockLag,
        address timelock,
        address manager
    ) BaseVotingVault(token, staleBlockLag) {
        if (timelock == address(0)) revert NBV_ZeroAddress("timelock");
        if (manager == address(0)) revert NBV_ZeroAddress("manager");

        Storage.set(Storage.uint256Ptr("initialized"), 1);
        Storage.set(Storage.addressPtr("timelock"), timelock);
        Storage.set(Storage.addressPtr("manager"), manager);
        Storage.set(Storage.uint256Ptr("entered"), 1);
        Storage.set(Storage.uint256Ptr("locked"), 0); // line changed
    }
```

Then, please add a basic `ERC20` token implementation to a `TestERC20.sol` file in the `contracts/test` directory (it's only used to mint some tokens to the users):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.18;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract TestERC20 is ERC20 
{
    constructor() ERC20("TestERC20", "TERC20") {
        
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

Finally, please put the following test inside `ArcadeGscVault.ts` (`import { mine } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers";` will have to be also inserted there):

### Tools Used

VS Code, hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `BaseVotingVault::queryVotePower` implementation so that it calls `find` instead of `findAndClear` (as in the `queryVotePowerView`).

### Assessed type

## [[M-04] User voting power is not synchronized after multiplier changes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/283)
*Submitted by [ktg](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/283), also found by [Viktor\_Cortess](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/545), [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/431), [0xmuxyz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/287), [0xbranded](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/226), [0x3b](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/225), [caventa](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/203), [sces60107](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/160), [0xnev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/117), [BenRai](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/102), and [0xastronatey](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/4)*

### Impact

*   User voting power is not synchronized after multiplier changes.
*   If the manager decreases the multiplier for a token, users' voting power will not be affected.

### Proof of Concept

Currently the function `setMultiplier` of contract `NFTBoostVault` is implemented as follows:

```solidity
    function setMultiplier(address tokenAddress, uint128 tokenId, uint128 multiplierValue) public override onlyManager {
        if (multiplierValue > MAX_MULTIPLIER) revert NBV_MultiplierLimit();

        NFTBoostVaultStorage.AddressUintUint storage multiplierData = _getMultipliers()[tokenAddress][tokenId];
        // set multiplier value
        multiplierData.multiplier = multiplierValue;

        emit MultiplierSet(tokenAddress, tokenId, multiplierValue);
    }
```

The problem with this code is that it does not update the user's voting power, even though their multiplier has changed. The contract did provide a function called `updateVotingPower` to update users' voting power as follows:

```solidity
    function updateVotingPower(address[] calldata userAddresses) public override {
        if (userAddresses.length > 50) revert NBV_ArrayTooManyElements();

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userAddresses.length; ++i) {
            NFTBoostVaultStorage.Registration storage registration = _getRegistrations()[userAddresses[i]];
            _syncVotingPower(userAddresses[i], registration);
        }
    }
```

We can argue that the manager can call this function to update users voting power after they change the multiplier; however, there are multiple problems with this solution:

*   The input of `updateVotingPower` is a list of user addresses, so the manager must have a map of the token id to a list of users using that token ID as their multiplier. However, this data is not saved in the contract. When users register, their registrations are tracked using a variable of type `map(address => NFTBoostVaultStorage.Registration)`. I've looked into the contracts and found no way to retrieve a list of users associated with a token ID, even the function `_registerAndDelegate` does not emit an event showing which `ERC1155` token ID the users used at registration time.
*   The function `updateVotingPower` only allows updating 50 addresses at a time, so if there are many users associated with a particular token ID, they have more time to try front running the manager.

Below is a POC for this issue. Place this file under the `test` folder with the name `VotingPowerNotUpdatedAfterMultiplierChange.ts` and run it using the command `npx hardhat test test/VotingPowerNotUpdatedAfterMultiplierChange.ts`.

The flow of this POC is as follows:

*   Alice is minted a reputation badge.
*   The reputation badge is then set as a multiplier by nft boost vault manager.
*   Alice uses this reputation badge to boost their voting power.
*   After the manager changes Alice's badge multiplier, their voting power is unchanged.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend creating a map of token IDs to a list of users, using that token as a multiplier, and synchronizing their voting power in the function `setMultiplier`.

This could be thought of as a "leak of value" since votes have some value, and this allows for a user to have more votes than expected in some scenarios.

## [[M-05] Users who have claimed before the update on the merkle tree will have no shares of the rewards afterward](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/213)
*Submitted by [0x3b](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/213), also found by [osmanozdemir1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/353) and [T1MOH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/219)*

Users who have claimed before an update on the merkle tree in [ArcadeAirdrop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeAirdrop.sol) are not going to be able to claim the extra rewards. The reward tokens will be left stuck in the contract, waiting for the manager to reclaim them.

### Proof of Concept

Due to the nature of how `ArcadeAirdrop` is made and [the expectation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeAirdrop.sol#L17-L19) that there might be a change in the merkle tree in the near future, users will expect to be able to claim the extra rewards (if they are increased on merkle root change). However, because there is a problematic [if stamen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol#L106-L107) (that is inherited in `ArcadeAirdrop` by [ArcadeMerkleRewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol)) users that have already claimed their rewards will have no share of the future ones.

Example:

1.  Alice and Bob both have **100** tokens set to be claimed on the Merkle tree.
2.  Alice claims their **100** tokens.
3.  The owner sees that there is a huge activity on the platform and wants to incentivize users, so they increase rewards (by changing the merkle root) to **120** tokens.
4.  Bob claims their **120** tokens
5.  Alice sees that and tries to claim the remainder of their **120** tokens (**20**), but the claim reverts because of this [if](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol#L106-L107)

```jsx
    function _validateWithdraw(uint256 totalGrant, bytes32[] memory merkleProof) internal {
        ...
        //@audit if the user has already claimed, he is not able to claim ever again
        if (claimed[msg.sender] != 0) revert AA_AlreadyClaimed();
        claimed[msg.sender] = totalGrant;
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the claim implementation the way how [mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L98-L120) in `ReputationBadge` is done. They have the [total amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L110C47-L110C61) in the merkle tree and track [claimed amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L116C1-L116C1) in a mapping.

## [[M-06] `ArcadeTreasury.sol` allowance may be overriden](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/85)
*Submitted by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/85), also found by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/535), [caventa](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/146), and [0xWaitress](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/55)*

Direct use of `IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);` causes the same `spender` allowances to be overridden by each other.

### Proof of Concept

In the `gscApprove()` method, it is possible to give `spender` a certain allowance.

The code is as follows:

```solidity
    function gscApprove(
        address token,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyRole(GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE) nonReentrant {
        if (spender == address(0)) revert T_ZeroAddress("spender");
        if (amount == 0) revert T_ZeroAmount();

        // Will underflow if amount is greater than remaining allowance
@>      gscAllowance[token] -= amount;

        _approve(token, spender, amount, spendThresholds[token].small);
    } 

    function _approve(address token, address spender, uint256 amount, uint256 limit) internal {
        // check that after processing this we will not have spent more than the block limit
        uint256 spentThisBlock = blockExpenditure[block.number];
        if (amount + spentThisBlock > limit) revert T_BlockSpendLimit();
        blockExpenditure[block.number] = amount + spentThisBlock;

        // approve tokens
@>      IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);

        emit TreasuryApproval(token, spender, amount);
    }    
```

From the above code, we can see that when executed, `gscApprove` consumes `gscAllowance[]` and ultimately uses `IERC20(token).approve();` to give the `spender` allowance. Since the direct use is `IERC20.approve(spender, amount)`, the amount of the allowance is overwritten, whichever comes last.

In the other method,s `approveSmallSpend`, `approveMediumSpend` and `approveLargeSpend` also use `IERC20(token).approve();`, which causes them to override each other if targeting the same `spender`.

Even if there is a malicious `GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE`, it is possible to execute `gscApprove(amount=1 wei)` after `approveLargeSpend()` to reset to an allowance of only `1 wei`.

The recommendation is to use accumulation to avoid, intentionally or unintentionally, overwriting each other.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```solidity
    function _approve(address token, address spender, uint256 amount, uint256 limit) internal {
        // check that after processing this we will not have spent more than the block limit
        uint256 spentThisBlock = blockExpenditure[block.number];
        if (amount + spentThisBlock > limit) revert T_BlockSpendLimit();
        blockExpenditure[block.number] = amount + spentThisBlock;

        // approve tokens
-      IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);
+      uint256 old = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this),spender);
+      IERC20(token).approve(spender,  old + amount);

        emit TreasuryApproval(token, spender, amount);
    } 
```

## [[M-07] `DAY_IN_BLOCKS` is incorrect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/70)
*Submitted by [Anirruth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/70), also found by [DadeKuma](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/574), [bart1e](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/228), [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/154), [Matin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/133), [giovannidisiena](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/112), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/73), and [MohammedRizwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade-findings/issues/56)*

The day in blocks is calculated with the block time as 13.3 seconds in CoreVoting.sol.:
`uint256 public constant DAY_IN_BLOCKS = 6496;`, but since moving to proof of stake, block times are fixed to 12 seconds per block. [Reference](<https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#:~:text=Whereas%20under%20proof%2Dof%2Dwork,block%20proposer%20in%20every%20slot>).

This results in an incorrect calculation of the `lockDuration` and `extraVoteTime`, which is used in setting the total duration of a proposal should be active and also the max vote time.

The time difference can be calculated:

`3*24*60*60 / 13.3` = 19488.721804511 (`lockDuration` with 13.3 seconds).<br>
`3*24*60*60 / 12` = 21600 (`lockDuration` with 12 seconds).<br>
21600 - 19488.7 = 2111.3<br>
`2111.3*12 / (60*60)` = 7.03 (difference in hours for `lockDuration`).

`5*24*60*60 / 13.3` = 32481.203007519 (`extraVoteTime` with 13.3 seconds).<br>
`5*24*60*60 / 12` = 36000 (`extraVoteTime` with 12 seconds).<br>
36000 - 32481.2 = 3518.8<br>
`3518.8*12 / (60*60)` = 11.72 (difference in hours `extraVoteTime`).

By using block time as 13.3 seconds, the `lockDuration` expires 7 hours earlier and the `extraVoteTime` expires 11.72 hours earlier. Since it is a significant time and affects the proposal and voting duration, I consider medium severity to be fair.

### Tools Used

VS code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`86400 / 12` = 7200<br>

### Proof of Concept

`GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE` calls the `gscApprove(...)` function to approve tokens to be pulled from the treasury:

        function gscApprove(
            address token,
            address spender,
            uint256 amount
        ) external onlyRole(GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE) nonReentrant {
            if (spender == address(0)) revert T_ZeroAddress("spender");
            if (amount == 0) revert T_ZeroAmount();


            // Will underflow if amount is greater than remaining allowance
            gscAllowance[token] -= amount;


            _approve(token, spender, amount, spendThresholds[token].small);
        }

Each approval will decrease the `gscAllowance[token]` by the approved allowance amount, this is problematic as `GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE` may not able to decrease the approved allowance.

Consider the following scenario:

1.  `gscAllowance[token]` is 100.
2.  `GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE` calls `gscApprove(...)` to give 60 allowance to a third party.
3.  `gscAllowance[token]` is 40 now;
4.  Later, `GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE` finds the approved allowance is a bit too high and wants to decrease the allowance to 50.
5.  `gscApprove(...)` is called again, but the transaction reverts due to an underflow error (`gscAllowance[token]` is less than 50).

Please see the tests:

    contract ArcadeTreasuryTest is Test {
        address timelock = address(1);
        address coreVoting = address(2);
        address gscCoreVoting = address(3);
        address other = address(4);

        ArcadeTreasury treasury;
        MockToken mockToken;

        function setUp() public {
            treasury = new ArcadeTreasury(timelock);

            vm.startPrank(timelock);
            treasury.grantRole(treasury.CORE_VOTING_ROLE(), coreVoting);
            treasury.grantRole(treasury.GSC_CORE_VOTING_ROLE(), gscCoreVoting);

            mockToken = new MockToken("Mock Token", "MT");
            IArcadeTreasury.SpendThreshold memory threshold = IArcadeTreasury.SpendThreshold(100 ether, 200 ether, 300 ether);
            treasury.setThreshold(address(mockToken), threshold);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        function testGscApprove() public {
            vm.warp(7 days);

            vm.prank(timelock);
            treasury.setGSCAllowance(address(mockToken), 100 ether);

            vm.startPrank(gscCoreVoting);
            treasury.gscApprove(address(mockToken), address(4), 60 ether);
            vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
            treasury.gscApprove(address(mockToken), address(4), 50 ether);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
    }

    contract MockToken is ERC20 {
        constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) ERC20(name_, symbol_) {}

        function mint(address account, uint256 amount) public {
            _mint(account, amount);
        }
    }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When approving a particular address, compare the new allowance with the current allowance ([IERC20.allowance(...)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/7222a31d548695998a475c9661fa159ef45a0e88/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L50)):

1.  If the current allowance is equal to the new allowance, do nothing.
2.  If the current allowance is less than the new allowance, `gscAllowance[token] -= (new allowance - current allowance)`.
3.  If the current allowance is larger than the new allowance, `gscAllowance[token] += (current allowance - new allowance)`.

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example, Tether (USDT)'s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

The function is marked as payable, but the surplus ether is not returned. This may lead to the loss of ether.

The condition should be changed to check for equality, or the code should refund the excess.

Certain tokens may not adhere to the ERC20 standard completely, yet they are generally accepted by most code designed for ERC20 tokens. An instance of this is Tether (USDT), where the `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions on L1 do not conform to the specification's requirement of returning booleans; instead, they have no return value.

Consequently, when such tokens are cast to IERC20, their function signatures do not align, leading to reverted calls (refer to this link for a test case). To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to utilize OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20's `safeTransfer()` and `safeTransferFrom()` functions instead.

## [L-01] The merkle root won't revert if is set to `0x00`

If merkle root is set to `0x00` it could leave the system in an insecure state where the system will accept any message that it has never seen before and process it as if it were genuine.

This has happened before in the [nomad bridge incident](https://medium.com/numen-cyber-labs/nomadic-bridge-attack-incident-analysis-94716b93fa61).

> The Nomad team initialized the trusted root to be `0x00`. To be clear, using zero values as initialization values is a common practice.

Instances:
- [ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol#L62](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/88dcbdedebc506284fcfb3f14d20fc789ce811cf/contracts/libraries/ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol#L62)
- [MerkleRewards.sol#L28](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/88dcbdedebc506284fcfb3f14d20fc789ce811cf/contracts/external/council/libraries/MerkleRewards.sol#L28)

## [L-02] `delegate()` can be called with no voting power

The `delegate()` functions in `ARCDVestingVault` and `NFTBoostVault` can be called by anyone, despite them not having any voting power.

This leads to changes in the storage variables, like pushing empty entries to the `votingPower`, and setting a `delegatee`, despite not delegating anything. 

As it will set a `registration.delegatee`, it will bypass the validations `if (registration.delegatee == address(0)) revert NBV_NoRegistration();` on `addTokens()`, and `updateNft()`. Making it possible to call those functions without "initializing" the corresponding registration storage via `addNftAndDelegate()`.

This can lead to unexpected effects.

Instances:

- [NFTBoostVault.sol#L182-L212](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L182-L212)
- [ARCDVestingVault.sol#L260-L282](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L260-L282)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Verify that `_currentVotingPower(registration) > 0`.

## [L-03] Use a two-step transfer function for the Minter role in `ArcadeToken`

The `ArcadeToken` has a very important Minter role which can be changed via a `setMinter()` function.

In order to prevent the role from mistakenly being transferred to an address that cannot handle it (e.g. due to a typo in the address), require that the recipient of the new minter role actively accepts via a contract call of its own.

Instances:
- [ArcadeToken.sol#L132-L137](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol#L132-L137)

## [L-04] `NFTBoostVault::updateNft()` allows to deposit any NFT

The function `addNftAndDelegate` reverts when depositing any random NFT because of the `if (multiplier == 0) revert NBV_NoMultiplierSet();` in `_registerAndDelegate()`.

But `updateNft()` does not have that check, which allows anyone to update and deposit any NFT, leading to a multiplier of 0; and thus a voting power of 0, despite the user having deposited any other tokens.

This might also be combined with other issues for a bigger severity issue. We recommend that the same check to revert on `multiplier == 0` is applied on `updateNft()`.

Instances:
- [NFTBoostVault.sol#L305-L330](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L305-L330)
- [NFTBoostVault.sol#L477](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L477)

## [L-05] If [`token`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/88dcbdedebc506284fcfb3f14d20fc789ce811cf/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L61) has hooks, the grant owner can revert when admin try to revoke the role

An evil granted owner can avoid being [`revoke`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/88dcbdedebc506284fcfb3f14d20fc789ce811cf/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L157). They can revert triggering a `DOS` to avoid a manager to revoke the role.

## [L-06] If [`token`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/88dcbdedebc506284fcfb3f14d20fc789ce811cf/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L61) has hooks, the manager could `reenter` to `revokeGrant` draining the contract

A token with a hook could leave a reentrancy issue, letting the manager drain funds.

## [L-07] The storage slots/hashes have known pre-images.

Knowledge of pre-images might allow manipulation of specific mapping parameters by crafting special keys. This is possible if a mapping parameter's storage slot lands on a specific slot.

It might be best to decrement them by "one" so that finding the pre-image would be harder.

Instances:
- [Storage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/88dcbdedebc506284fcfb3f14d20fc789ce811cf/contracts/external/council/libraries/Storage.sol)

Example:
```solidity
bytes32 typehash = keccak256("mapping(address => AddressUint)");
bytes32 offset = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(typehash, name));
assembly {
    data.slot := sub(offset, 1) // keccak256(NAME) - 1, to avoid preimage attack
}
```

Also please review this [eip-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967#security-considerations)

## [L-08] Type of `tokenId` in `ReputationBadge` and `NftBoostVault` do not match and can lead to tokens not being usable as multipliers

`ReputationBadge` tokens are meant to be used as multipliers of voting power in `NftBoostVault`.

Users can mint badges with `tokenId` up to `uint256`, but `NftBoostVault` only allows to set `tokenId` up to `uint128` to work as multipliers.

Tokens with `tokenId > type(uint128).max` won't be able to be used as multipliers.

`tokenId` in `ReputationBadge` (uint256):

```solidity
    function mint(
        address recipient,
@>      uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 totalClaimable,
        bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
    ) external payable {
```

[ReputationBadge.sol#L100](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L100)

`tokenId` in `NftBoostVault` (uint128):

```solidity
@>  function setMultiplier(address tokenAddress, uint128 tokenId, uint128 multiplierValue) public override onlyManager {
```

[NFTBoostVault.sol#L363](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L363)

Consider setting the same `tokenId` type for the expected NFTs to be used in the contract.

## [L-09] You can bypass the ERC1155 check and deposit anything if `tokenId == 0`

The check on [NFTBoostVault.sol#L472](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/88dcbdedebc506284fcfb3f14d20fc789ce811cf/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L472) can be easily bypassed if the ERC1155 token id is `0`:<br>

`if (_tokenAddress != address(0) && _tokenId != 0) {`

## [L-10] Approve zero first

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example, Tether, (USDT)'s `approve()` function, will revert if the current approval is not zero to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

Instances:

## Non-Critical Findings

## [N-01] `NFTBoostVault` sets an unused `initialized` value in storage

The `"initialized"` storage variable is set on the constructor, but not used by the `NFTBoostVault`, or another contract, and can't be accessed by any public or external method.

### Recommendation

Verify if it is actually needed, or remove it in case it is not.

```solidity
Storage.set(Storage.uint256Ptr("initialized"), 1); // @audit check
```

[NFTBoostVault.sol#L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L91)

## [N-02] `ARCDVestingVault` inherits twice from `HashedStorageReentrancyBlock`

`ARCDVestingVault` inherits both from `HashedStorageReentrancyBlock` and `BaseVotingVault`. But `BaseVotingVault` is already inheriting from `HashedStorageReentrancyBlock`.

Remove the unnecessary inheritance from `HashedStorageReentrancyBlock` on `ARCDVestingVault`.

## Possible Optimizations in [ArcadeTreasury.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol)

### General Optimization
Reducing the number of state variable updates can save gas. In Ethereum, every storage operation costs a significant amount of gas. Therefore, optimizing the contract to minimize storage operations can lead to substantial gas savings.

### Possible Optimization 1
In the [_spend](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol#L358C1-L373C6) and [_approve](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol#L384C1-L394C6) functions, the [blockExpenditure](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol#L360) mapping is updated twice. This can be optimized to a single update, which would save gas.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 

```solidity
function _spend(address token, uint256 amount, address destination, uint256 limit) internal {
    uint256 spentThisBlock = blockExpenditure[block.number] + amount;
    if (spentThisBlock > limit) revert T_BlockSpendLimit();
    blockExpenditure[block.number] = spentThisBlock;
    if (address(token) == ETH_CONSTANT) {
        payable(destination).transfer(amount);
    } else {
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(destination, amount);
    }
    emit TreasuryTransfer(token, destination, amount);
}

function _approve(address token, address spender, uint256 amount, uint256 limit) internal {
    uint256 spentThisBlock = blockExpenditure[block.number] + amount;
    if (spentThisBlock > limit) revert T_BlockSpendLimit();
    blockExpenditure[block.number] = spentThisBlock;
    IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);
    emit TreasuryApproval(token, spender, amount);
}
```
Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization reduces the number of storage operations from 2 to 1 in each of the _spend and _approve functions. Given that a storage operation costs 20,000 gas, this optimization could save approximately 20,000 gas per call to these functions.

### Possible Optimization 2
The [batchCalls](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol#L333C1-L345C6) function can be optimized by removing the check [if (spendThresholds[targets[i]].small != 0) revert T_InvalidTarget(targets[i]);](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol#L340). This check is not necessary because if the target contract does not exist or does not have a function that matches the provided `calldata`, the call will fail anyway. Removing this check can save gas.

Here is the optimized code: 

```solidity
function batchCalls(
    address[] memory targets,
    bytes[] calldata calldatas
) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) nonReentrant {
    if (targets.length != calldatas.length) revert T_ArrayLengthMismatch();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets.length; ++i) {
        (bool success, ) = targets[i].call(calldatas[i]);
        if (!success) revert T_CallFailed();
    }
}
```
Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization removes a storage read operation from the `batchCalls` function. Given that a storage read operation costs 200 gas, this optimization could save approximately 200 gas per call to this function. However, the actual gas savings would be higher when considering the gas cost of the conditional check and the potential revert operation.

## Possible Optimizations in [BaseVotingVault.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol)

### General Optimization
The contract uses the ``onlyManager`` and ``onlyTimelock`` modifiers in multiple functions. These modifiers check if the caller is the ``manager`` or the ``timelock``. However, these checks could be optimized by creating a new modifier that directly checks the ``msg.sender`` against the ``manager`` or ``timelock``, saving the gas used by the function call.

### Possible Optimization 1
The [queryVotePower](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol#L96C1-L102C6) function calls the [findAndClear](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol#L101C29-L101C41) function, which iterates over the [votingPower](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol#L101C16-L101C40) mapping and clears entries that are older than ``staleBlockLag``. This could be optimized by only clearing entries when the number of entries exceeds a certain limit. This would reduce the number of storage operations, which are expensive in terms of gas.

After Optimization:

```solidity
function queryVotePower(address user, uint256 blockNumber, bytes calldata) external override returns (uint256) {
    // Get our reference to historical data
    History.HistoricalBalances memory votingPower = _votingPower();

    // Find the historical data and clear everything more than 'staleBlockLag' into the past
    // only if the number of entries exceeds a certain limit (e.g., 100)
    if (votingPower.numEntries(user) > 100) {
        return votingPower.findAndClear(user, blockNumber, block.number - staleBlockLag);
    } else {
        return votingPower.find(user, blockNumber);
    }
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization reduces the number of storage operations, which costs 20,000 gas each. The actual gas saved would depend on the number of entries in the `votingPower` mapping for a user. If there are more than 100 entries, this optimization could save approximately 20,000 gas per extra entry.

### Possible Optimization 2
The [setTimelock](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol#L68C2-L72C6) and [setManager](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol#L80C3-L84C6) functions update the [timelock](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol#L69C1-L71C64) and [manager](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol#L81C7-L83C62) addresses. These functions could be optimized by checking if the new address is different from the current one before updating. This would save gas when the new address is the same as the current one.

After Optimization:

```solidity
function setTimelock(address timelock_) external onlyTimelock {
    if (timelock_ == address(0)) revert BVV_ZeroAddress("timelock");
    if (timelock_ != timelock()) {
        Storage.set(Storage.addressPtr("timelock"), timelock_);
    }
}

function setManager(address manager_) external onlyTimelock {
    if (manager_ == address(0)) revert BVV_ZeroAddress("manager");
    if (manager_ != manager()) {
        Storage.set(Storage.addressPtr("manager"), manager_);
    }
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 5,000 to 10,000 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the storage operation.

## Possible Optimizations in [ARCDVestingVault.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol)

### Possible Optimization 1
In the [addGrantAndDelegate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L91C5-L150C1) function, there are multiple calls to [Storage.Uint256 storage unassigned = _unassigned();](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L114) and [ARCDVestingVaultStorage.Grant storage grant = _grants()[who];](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L118). These calls could be optimized by declaring them once at the beginning of the function and reusing the reference. This would save the gas used by the function call.

After Optimization:

```solidity
function addGrantAndDelegate(
    address who,
    uint128 amount,
    uint128 cliffAmount,
    uint128 startTime,
    uint128 expiration,
    uint128 cliff,
    address delegatee
) external onlyManager {
    Storage.Uint256 storage unassigned = _unassigned();
    ARCDVestingVaultStorage.Grant storage grant = _grants()[who];

    // input validation
    if (who == address(0)) revert AVV_ZeroAddress("who");
    if (amount == 0) revert AVV_InvalidAmount();

    // if no custom start time is needed we use this block.
    if (startTime == 0) {
        startTime = uint128(block.number);
    }
    // grant schedule check
    if (cliff >= expiration || cliff < startTime) revert AVV_InvalidSchedule();

    // cliff check
    if (cliffAmount >= amount) revert AVV_InvalidCliffAmount();

    if (unassigned.data < amount) revert AVV_InsufficientBalance(unassigned.data);

    // if this address already has a grant, a different address must be provided
    // topping up or editing active grants is not supported.
    if (grant.allocation != 0) revert AVV_HasGrant();

    // load the delegate. Defaults to the grant owner
    delegatee = delegatee == address(0) ? who : delegatee;

    // calculate the voting power. Assumes all voting power is initially locked.
    uint128 newVotingPower = amount;

    // set the new grant
    grant.allocation = amount;
    grant.cliffAmount = cliffAmount;
    grant.withdrawn = 0;
    grant.created = startTime;
    grant.expiration = expiration;
    grant.cliff = cliff;
    grant.latestVotingPower = newVotingPower;
    grant.delegatee = delegatee;

    // update the amount of unassigned tokens
    unassigned.data -= amount;

    // update the delegatee's voting power
    History.HistoricalBalances memory votingPower = _votingPower();
    uint256 delegateeVotes = votingPower.loadTop(grant.delegatee);
    votingPower.push(grant.delegatee, delegateeVotes + newVotingPower);

    emit VoteChange(grant.delegatee, who, int256(uint256(newVotingPower)));
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 1000 to 2000 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the function call.

### Possible Optimization 2
In the [claim](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L228C1-L253C6) function, there are multiple calls to [ARCDVestingVaultStorage.Grant storage grant = _grants()[msg.sender];](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L232C1-L249C45). This could be optimized by declaring it once at the beginning of the function and reusing the reference. This would save the gas used by the function call.

After Optimization:

```solidity
function claim(uint256 amount) external override nonReentrant {
    ARCDVestingVaultStorage.Grant storage grant = _grants()[msg.sender];

    if (amount == 0) revert AVV_InvalidAmount();

    if (grant.allocation == 0) revert AVV_NoGrantSet();
    if (grant.cliff > block.number) revert AVV_CliffNotReached(grant.cliff);

    // get the withdrawable amount
    uint256 withdrawable = _getWithdrawableAmount(grant);
    if (amount > withdrawable) revert AVV_InsufficientBalance(withdrawable);

    // update the grant's withdrawn amount
    if (amount == withdrawable) {
        grant.withdrawn += uint128(withdrawable);
    } else {
        grant.withdrawn += uint128(amount);
        withdrawable = amount;
    }

    // update the user's voting power
    _syncVotingPower(msg.sender, grant);

    // transfer the available amount
    token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, withdrawable);
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 1000 to 2000 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the function call.

### Possible Optimization 3
In the [revokeGrant](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol#L157C5-L186C6) function, the contract performs a number of operations after checking if the grant allocation is zero. If the allocation is zero, these operations are unnecessary. By using a return statement after the revert, we can avoid these unnecessary operations.

Before:

```solidity
// if the grant has already been removed or no grant available, revert
if (grant.allocation == 0) revert AVV_NoGrantSet();
```

After: 

```solidity
// if the grant has already been removed or no grant available, revert
if (grant.allocation == 0) {
    revert AVV_NoGrantSet();
    return;
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 5,000 to 10,000 gas per transaction, depending on the number of operations that are skipped.

## Possible Optimizations in [NFTBoostVault.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol)

### Possible Optimization 1
In the [addNftAndDelegate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L114C1-L126C6) function, the amount is checked to be non-zero at the beginning of the function. However, the amount is not used until after the [_registerAndDelegate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L122C7-L122C84) function call. Moving the zero check closer to the usage of the amount could save gas in the case where [_registerAndDelegate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L122C7-L122C84) reverts, as the zero check would not have been performed.

After Optimization:

```solidity
function addNftAndDelegate(
    uint128 amount,
    uint128 tokenId,
    address tokenAddress,
    address delegatee
) external override nonReentrant {
    _registerAndDelegate(msg.sender, amount, tokenId, tokenAddress, delegatee);
    if (amount == 0) revert NBV_ZeroAmount();
    _lockTokens(msg.sender, uint256(amount), tokenAddress, tokenId, 1);
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 200 to 500 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the [_registerAndDelegate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L122C7-L122C84) function call.

### Possible Optimization 2
In the [_registerAndDelegate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L462C5-L510C6) function, the multiplier is set to [1e3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L469C9-L469C34) by default and then potentially updated if [_tokenAddress](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L472C1-L477C63) and [_tokenId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L472C1-L477C63) are non-zero. However, the [getMultiplier](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L421C1-L424C10) function already returns [1e3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L421C1-L424C10) if [_tokenAddress](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L421C1-L424C10) or [_tokenId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L421C1-L424C10) are zero. Therefore, the initial setting of the multiplier to `1e3` is unnecessary and can be removed.

After Optimization: 

```solidity
if (_tokenAddress != address(0) && _tokenId != 0 && IERC1155(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(user, _tokenId) == 0) {
    revert NBV_DoesNotOwn();
}
uint128 multiplier = getMultiplier(_tokenAddress, _tokenId);
if (multiplier == 0) revert NBV_NoMultiplierSet();
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 200 to 500 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the ``getMultiplier`` function call.

### Possible Optimization 3
In the [_syncVotingPower](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L579C1-L599C6) function, the [change](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L588C5-L594C10) variable is calculated and then checked to be non-zero. If the change is zero, the function returns early. However, the [change](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L588C5-L594C10) calculation involves subtraction and two castings, which are relatively expensive operations. By checking if [newVotingPower](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L583C8-L583C68) and [registration.latestVotingPower](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L596C1-L596C66) are equal before performing the change calculation, we can potentially avoid these operations.

After Optimization:

```solidity
if (newVotingPower == registration.latestVotingPower) return;
int256 change = int256(newVotingPower) - int256(uint256(registration.latestVotingPower));
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 500 to 1000 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the subtraction and casting operations.

## Possible Optimization in [ArcadeToken.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol)

In the [mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol#L145C1-L160C6) function, the [mintingAllowedAfter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol#L146C1-L151C72) variable is updated before the minting cap check. This means that even if the minting cap check fails and reverts the transaction, the [mintingAllowedAfter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol#L146C1-L151C72) variable will still have been updated, wasting gas. Moving the [mintingAllowedAfter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol#L146C1-L151C72) update after the minting cap check could save gas in the case where the minting cap check fails.

After Optimization:

```solidity
uint256 mintCapAmount = (totalSupply() * MINT_CAP) / PERCENT_DENOMINATOR;
if (_amount > mintCapAmount) {
    revert AT_MintingCapExceeded(totalSupply(), mintCapAmount, _amount);
}
mintingAllowedAfter = block.timestamp + MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_MINTS;
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 5000 to 10000 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the [totalSupply](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol#L153C3-L157C10) function call and the multiplication and division operations.

## Possible Optimization in [ArcadeTokenDistributor.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeTokenDistributor.sol)

This contract uses separate [boolean](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeTokenDistributor.sol#L34C5-L59C36) flags to track if each [distribution](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeTokenDistributor.sol#L34C5-L59C36) has been sent. These flags could be combined into a single ``uint256`` (or ``uint8`` for even more gas savings) with each bit representing a different ``distribution``. This would save gas by reducing the number of storage slots used.

[Before Optimization](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/token/ArcadeTokenDistributor.sol#L73C1-L82C6) 

After Optimization:

```solidity
// Combine distribution flags into a single uint8
uint8 public distributionsSent;

function toTreasury(address _treasury) external onlyOwner {
    // Check if the treasury distribution has not been sent (first bit of distributionsSent is 0)
    // and if the _treasury address is not zero
    require((distributionsSent & 1 == 0) && _treasury != address(0), "AT_AlreadySent or zero address");

    // Set the first bit of distributionsSent to 1 (indicating that the treasury distribution has been sent)
    distributionsSent |= 1;

    // Transfer the treasury amount of tokens to the _treasury address
    arcadeToken.safeTransfer(_treasury, treasuryAmount);

    // Emit a Distribute event
    emit Distribute(address(arcadeToken), _treasury, treasuryAmount);
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 5000 to 20000 gas per transaction, depending on the number of distributions. This is because the ``SSTORE`` opcode, which is used to update storage, is one of the most expensive operations in terms of gas cost. By reducing the number of storage slots used, we can save a significant amount of gas. 

## Possible Optimizations in [ReputationBadge.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol)

### Possible Optimization 1
In the [mint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L98C1-L120C6) function, the [mintPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L105C8-L105C58) is calculated by multiplying [mintPrices[tokenId]](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L105C8-L105C58) with amount. However, this calculation is performed before the checks for [claimExpiration](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L106C9-L106C60), [msg.value < mintPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L109C13-L109C35), and [_verifyClaim](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L110C12-L110C26). If any of these checks fail, the [mintPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L105C8-L105C58) calculation would have been performed unnecessarily. Moving the [mintPrice](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L105C8-L105C58) calculation after these checks could save gas in the case where any of these checks fail.

After Optimization:

```solidity
uint48 claimExpiration = claimExpirations[tokenId];

if (block.timestamp > claimExpiration) revert RB_ClaimingExpired(claimExpiration, uint48(block.timestamp));
if (!_verifyClaim(recipient, tokenId, totalClaimable, merkleProof)) revert RB_InvalidMerkleProof();
if (amountClaimed[recipient][tokenId] + amount > totalClaimable) {
    revert RB_InvalidClaimAmount(amount, totalClaimable);
}

uint256 mintPrice = mintPrices[tokenId] * amount;
if (msg.value < mintPrice) revert RB_InvalidMintFee(mintPrice, msg.value);

// increment amount claimed
amountClaimed[recipient][tokenId] += amount;

// mint to recipient
_mint(recipient, tokenId, amount, "");

```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 200 to 500 gas per transaction, depending on the gas cost of the multiplication operation.

### Possible Optimization 2
The [publishRoots](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L140C4-L156C6) function uses a loop to update [claimRoots](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L150C11-L150C73), [claimExpirations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L151C10-L151C85), and [mintPrices](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L152C12-L152C73) for each [tokenId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L150C38-L150C45). However, the [tokenId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L150C38-L150C45) is not checked for uniqueness, which means that the same [tokenId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L150C38-L150C45) could be updated multiple times in a single transaction, wasting gas. Adding a check to ensure that each [tokenId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/main/contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol#L150C38-L150C45) is unique could save gas.

After Optimization:

```solidity
function publishRoots(ClaimData[] calldata _claimData) external onlyRole(BADGE_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    if (_claimData.length == 0) revert RB_NoClaimData();
    if (_claimData.length > 50) revert RB_ArrayTooLarge();

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _claimData.length; i++) {
        // uniqueness check
        if (claimRoots[_claimData[i].tokenId] != bytes32(0)) revert RB_TokenIdNotUnique();

        // expiration check
        if (_claimData[i].claimExpiration <= block.timestamp) {
            revert RB_InvalidExpiration(_claimData[i].claimRoot, _claimData[i].tokenId);
        }

        claimRoots[_claimData[i].tokenId] = _claimData[i].claimRoot;
        claimExpirations[_claimData[i].tokenId] = _claimData[i].claimExpiration;
        mintPrices[_claimData[i].tokenId] = _claimData[i].mintPrice;
    }

    emit RootsPublished(_claimData);
}
```

Estimated gas saved:<br>
This optimization could save around 5000 to 10000 gas per transaction, depending on the number of ``tokenIds`` that are not unique. This is because the ``SSTORE`` opcode, which is used to update storage, is one of the most expensive operations in terms of gas cost. By reducing the number of unnecessary ``SSTORE`` operations, we can save a significant amount of gas.

## Overview of Arcade.xyz platform

Arcade.xyz is a platform for autonomous borrowing, lending, and escrow of NFT collateral on EVM blockchains. This governance system is built on the `Council Framework`.

Arcade governance is classified into 4 types: 
- `Voting Vaults`: Each voting vault contract is a separate deployment, which handles its deposits and vote-counting mechanisms for those deposits.
- `Core Voting`: These contracts can be used to submit and vote on proposed governance transactions. Core voting contracts may either administrate the protocol directly or may be intermediated by a `Timelock` contract.
- `Token`: The ERC20 governance token, along with contracts required for initial deployment and distribution of the token (airdrop contract, initial distributor contract).
- `NFT`: The ERC1155 token contract along with its `tokenURI` descriptor contract. The ERC1155 token is used in governance to give a multiplier to a user's voting power.
     
### My Thoughts

Arcade.xyz is a platform to change the future in the following areas:

- It provides a way for users to have a say in how the protocol is governed. This is important because it gives users more control over their assets and ensures that the protocol is aligned with their interests.

- The Arcade governance system is designed to be scalable. This means that it can be used to govern large and complex DeFi protocols. This is important because it will allow DeFi protocols to grow and evolve without sacrificing decentralization.

- The Arcade governance system is secure. This is because it is built on the Council Framework, which is a battle-tested governance system. This means that the Arcade governance system is less likely to be exploited by malicious actors


### Audit approach

I followed the steps below while analyzing and auditing the code base:

1. Read the audit Readme.md and took the required notes.
   - Arcade.xyz platform uses 
   - Inheritance
   - NFT
   - Timelock Functions
   - ERC20
   - The test coverage is 99%

2. Analyzed the overall codebase on iterations very fast.

3. Study of documentation to understand each contract's purpose, its functionality, how it is connected with other contracts, etc.

4. Then I read old audits and known findings. Then went through the bot race findings.

5. Then I setup my testing environment things. Run the tests to checks all test passed.

6. Finally, I started with auditing the codebase in-depth. I started understanding the code line by line and took the necessary notes to ask some questions to sponsors.

### Stages of audit

- `The first stage of the audit`: During the initial stage of the audit for the Arcade.xyz platform, the primary focus was on analyzing gas usage and quality assurance (QA) aspects. This phase of the audit aimed to ensure the efficiency of gas consumption and verify the robustness of the platform.

- `The second stage of the audit`: In the second stage of the audit for the Arcade.xyz platform, the focus shifted towards understanding the protocol usage in more detail. This involved identifying and analyzing the important contracts and functions within the system. By examining these key components of the audit, I aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the protocol's functionality and potential risks. 

- `The third stage of the audit`: During the third stage of the audit for the Arcade.xyz platform, the focus was on thoroughly examining and marking any doubtful or vulnerable areas within the protocol. This stage involved conducting comprehensive vulnerability assessments and identifying potential weaknesses in the system. Found `60-70`, `vulnerable`, and `weakness` code parts all marked with `@audit tags`.

- `The fourth stage of the audit`: During the fourth stage of the audit for the Arcade.xyz platform, a comprehensive analysis and testing of the previously identified doubtful and vulnerable areas were conducted. This stage involved diving deeper into these areas, performing in-depth examinations, and subjecting them to rigorous testing; including fuzzing with various inputs. Finally concluded findings after all research and tests. Then I reported to C4 with proper formats. 

### Learnings

Arcade.xyz's governance system, we can understand several key learnings:

- `Decentralized Governance`: Arcade.xyz allows token holders to vote on platform decisions, ensuring that no single entity or group has complete control. It's a democratic way of making choices for the platform.

- `Voting Vaults and Delegation`: Users can deposit their voting tokens in separate vaults and also delegate their voting power to someone they trust, making it easier for more people to participate in voting.

- `ERC20 and ERC1155 Tokens`: Arcade.xyz uses two types of tokens - ERC20 for basic voting and ERC1155 for more advanced governance features, like giving some tokens more voting influence.

- `Council Framework`: The governance system follows a specific Council Framework, which outlines rules and guidelines for how decisions are made.

- `Protocol Administrations and Timelock`: Proposals can directly impact the platform or go through a `Timelock` first, adding a delay to allow community review and transparency.

- `Autonomy and Smart Contracts`: Once set up, the governance system operates autonomously using smart contracts, without needing central control.

- `Transparency and Openness`: Arcade.xyz is transparent about how things work, providing clear technical details for users to understand and participate effectively.

- `NFT Integration`: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can enhance voting power, incentivizing community involvement and participation.

### Possible Systemic Risks

- **Centralization Risk**: Voting power could concentrate among a few, leading to centralization.

- **Delegate Control Concerns**: Delegation may reduce voter engagement and representativeness.

- **Low Participation**: Low turnout may undermine governance legitimacy.

- **Ineffective Proposals**: Poorly designed proposals may hinder progress.

- **Voting Manipulation**: Malicious actors may try to influence outcomes.

- **Token Concentration**: Unequal token distribution may skew decisions.

- **NFT Impact Uncertainty**: ERC1155 NFTs' effects may have unintended consequences.

- **Technical Vulnerabilities**: Smart contract bugs could compromise governance.

- **Community Disagreements**: Conflicts may impede decision-making.

- **Governance Rule Updates**: Changing rules may be challenging and require consensus.

### Code Commentary

- Instead of using bytes32 constants for role identifiers, consider using an enum for better readability and code organization.

- Functions like `smallSpend`, `mediumSpend`, and `largeSpend` have similar logic. Consider refactoring the code to combine the common logic into a single internal function and call it from each respective function. This can reduce code duplication.

- For events like `TreasuryTransfer` and `TreasuryApproval`, consider emitting only relevant data instead of emitting the entire amount and destination/spender.

- The "immutable" variable should be in upper case.

- Instead of using error messages in revert statements, consider using an enum to define error codes. This can make error handling more structured and easier to understand.

- Ensure that error messages are clear and informative to help developers and users understand contract behavior and potential issues.

- The contract could benefit from more detailed comments and documentation to explain the purpose of various functions, their expected behavior, and any potential risks or constraints. This would make it easier for developers to understand and interact with the contract.

- Consider reordering the modifiers in the function declarations to improve readability. For example, move the `onlyManager` modifier to be the last one, as it's the most specific and should be applied after other access control checks.

- Consider using a struct to represent grant data instead of individual storage variables. This can make the code cleaner and easier to manage.

- Instead of importing the entire ERC20 contract, consider using an ERC20 interface with only the necessary functions. This helps to reduce contract deployment costs.

- The contract uses a mix of `camelCase` and `snake_case` for function and variable names. It's advisable to use a consistent naming convention throughout the contract to enhance readability.

- There are some duplicated code segments (e.g., handling delegation and voting power updates) that could be abstracted into separate helper functions to improve code readability and maintainability.

- While the contract has some comments, additional documentation could be provided to clarify the purpose and behavior of certain functions and variables.

- In functions where multiple events are emitted, consider consolidating them into a single emit statement for better gas efficiency.

### Centralization risks

A single point of failure is not acceptable for this project. Centrality risk is high in the project, the role of `onlyOwner` detailed below has very critical and important powers.

Project and funds may be compromised by a malicious or stolen private key `onlyOwner` `msg.sender`:

### Gas Optimizations

During the audit of the smart contracts on `Arcade.xyz's` governance platform, several key gas optimization issues were identified. These issues could potentially lead to increased transaction costs and inefficiencies on the Ethereum network. One of the notable findings was related to state variables, where it was observed that they can be packed together to utilize fewer storage slots. By organizing related variables in this way, the number of storage operations, such as `SSTORE` and `SLOAD` opcodes, can be reduced, resulting in significant gas savings.

Another prevalent optimization opportunity involved caching state variables in stack variables instead of repeatedly re-reading them from storage. This approach can eliminate redundant storage operations, leading to improved gas efficiency. Utilizing opcodes like `SWAP`, `DUP`, and `MLOAD` efficiently allows for cost-effective access to state variables during contract execution.

In addition, a gas-saving technique was found in arithmetic operations on state variables. It was observed that using the `=` operator rather than `+=` and `-=` could result in reduced gas consumption for the `ADD`, `SUB`, and `MSTORE` opcodes. Moving `IF` statements or `require()` functions that check input arguments to the top of the functions was another recommendation to avoid unnecessary code execution; thereby, saving gas. This optimization takes advantage of the `JUMP` and `JUMPI` opcodes, which control the flow of execution within the contract.

Furthermore, multiple accesses of mappings or arrays were identified as potential areas for improvement. By employing local variable caches, redundant read operations from storage can be minimized, reducing gas costs. The relevant opcodes in this context include `MLOAD`, `MSTORE`, and `SLOAD`.

Moreover, it was noticed that emitting state variables when stack variables are available could lead to unnecessary gas consumption. Emitting state variables involves storage operations, while stack variables are more gas-efficient. The `LOG` opcode is used for emitting event logs.

Lastly, optimizing function parameters by using `calldata` instead of `memory` can save gas. The `CALLDATASIZE` opcode is used to access the size of the input data, and `CALLDATALOAD` is used to retrieve specific function parameters from the input.

### Possible Risks as per my analysis

- The `batchCalls` function allows executing multiple low-level calls in a single transaction. If a large number of calls are included or if any of the calls fail, the entire transaction will be reverted, leading to gas wastage. This can result in higher transaction costs and failed transactions due to gas limits.

- The `smallSpend`, `mediumSpend`, `largeSpend`, `approveSmallSpend`, `approveMediumSpend`, and `approveLargeSpend` functions do not perform input validation to check whether the `amount` parameter exceeds the token balance or allowance. This could lead to unintended spending or approval of more tokens than the treasury holds or intends to allow.

- The `_spend` and ` _approve` functions enforce a per-block spending/approval limit (`limit`) to avoid excessive spending. However, there is no mechanism to reset the `blockExpenditure` storage variable when a new block starts, which could lead to inconsistencies if the contract is active across multiple blocks.

- In the `_spend` function, if the destination is a contract without a `receive function`, the transfer will fail, resulting in a `loss of funds`. The function should include checks to handle such cases appropriately.

- Hardcoded `cooldown period` may cause problems in the future.

- Lack of same value input control in critical `setMinter()` functions.

- Use `safeInceaseAllowance()`/`safeDecreaseAllowance()` instead of `approve()` or deprecated `safeApprove()` functions.

- Don't use `payable(address).tranfer()` to avoid unexpected fund loss.

- The function `addGrantAndDelegate` allows the manager to create a new grant without checking if the grant recipient already has an active grant. If a user already has an active grant, this function will overwrite the existing grant, which might lead to unintended behavior. It would be better to check if the recipient already has a grant and handle this situation accordingly.

- In the `_getWithdrawableAmount` function, there are multiple arithmetic calculations involving subtraction, addition, and multiplication. Ensure that these calculations do not result in underflow or overflow situations, which could lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities.

- The contract uses a custom state management system with the Storage library, which might make it harder to understand for developers not familiar with this approach. Consider using standardized storage patterns to improve code readability and maintainability.

- Some functions, such as `_lockNft`, `_lockTokens`, and `_grantVotingPower`, are marked as internal but are not strictly necessary to be internal. It's essential to assess whether these functions need to be called from other contracts or external interactions.
